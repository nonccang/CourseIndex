          Seeing others' websites, I felt I didn't consider design stuff for my website.<br>
          I changed my plan since I think I can't make the interaction I wanted by the due date of the project <br>
          <img src="./img/new mainpage.jpg"><br>
          Using the photo I took for the photography for communication class, I made a new background.<br>
          And then, I changed its opacity. Meanwhile, I didn't want to change the whole thing.<br>
          Inspiring the layouts of apps and websites like Pinterest. I put a rounded corner to each box.
          <br> I also felt I need to reconsider of the layouts for the process reflection page.<br>
          I moved the rotating circles things to the reading response page instead.

        <p>To submit project2, I needed to make a webpage for it. I had two things to concern. One is I had too many sketches.<br>
         I was worried about how to organize.  The second is their huge size (1000x1000 px).
          
I searched for the w3school<br> to get a hint. I found<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_full_page_tabs.asp"> "How TO - Full Page Tabs"</a>. I used this method. I had no idea about the javascript. So, I basically<br> copied and pasted and then changed the name and sizes.

 Based on the feedback, I added the other button using <a href ="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp"> dropdowns contents </a>
 from w3school.
