        <p>Using p5 js during project2, I thought I can make a basic drawing tool. Using mouseX and mouseY, we could draw many circles during the class. Using this method, I made a brush. Using the "if statement", I made various functions such as changing the brush sizes with stroke Weight, Eraser matching the background colours. The last submission requirement of project 2 which was the high resolution of the image also helped to make the save button. 
         And then I updated the main banner.
        </p><br>
        <img src="./img/other contents.jpg">
        <img src="./img/mainbanner updated1.jpg">


        <br />
        <p>I had some issues with my main banner.
            I couldn't fit with the background rectangle and the 3 rectangles above. I tried to think outside of the box using nth-child. So, I could solve the problem but I realized that I could also use "space between" after then. This way was more simple.
        
            <img src="./img/Detail problem.jpg">
            <img src="./img/solved.jpg">
        </p>
  
        <br />
      
        <h2>Apr.28.2022</h2>
        <p>I tried to make a project 3 webpage. I need a consistency of the style for the project's webpage with a little variation. So, following the project 1 style, I put the part of the final image as a background. I put the final image on the left and put the title on the right as a variation.
            <img src="./img/p3.jpg">

            I was concerned about how to put the long texts. Unlike other projects, this one included a lot of text such as my observations and brainstorming. I didn't want to make infinite scrolling down. So, I searched for w3school again. I found the overflow. I used it for stages 1 and 2.
