 <h4>Feature ( 2 weeks ) </h4>
 <p>Making the progress of my infographic, I wrote what I notice some feature 

  when I used YouTube for 2 weeks.</p> 
  <br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;- I usually watch gaming or entertainment videos when I have dinner or lunch.   <br><br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;  -I listen to music when I do assignments or draw. <br><br> 

  &nbsp; &nbsp;-Sometimes, I search for cooking videos before eating lunch or dinner  <br><br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;-I usually pick recommended videos, however, if I can’t find what I wanted, I start to search (max 15 times   &nbsp; &nbsp;scrolling) 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-Before I sleep, I use YouTube via my phone.    <br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;-When I decide to have a break time of around 10 min, I usually watch videos related to art and design. . 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-To change the mood, I search other music.  
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-I barely use YouTube on Monday and Wednesday (sometimes Thursday). 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-I spend YouTube around 5-6 hours during the day. Music 3h/ watching gaming 1h 40m/ design-related 30m/  &nbsp; &nbsp; others ( entertainment, movie reviews, cooking....) 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-I usually share a video when I find something funny or useful resources or good songs. 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-I spent YouTube via smartphone around 1-2hours 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-My subscription channels are to get some knowledge such as design, movies, and drawings. 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-I highly related on YouTube auto play and recommendation. 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-6 videos I select per a day except for auto play. 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-I open 5~6times per a day 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-Maximum 2hours is effective to use YouTube.  
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;-After 2hours, I don't want to listen or watch and become less concentrated. 
<br><br>

  <h2>Design/Iterate</h2>
  <div class="sub">
   <b> Ideation </b> 
  </div>
  <p>I was struggling to come up with the idea of an infographic. One of the reasons was I only knew
     about just a normal infographic with bar charts and pie charts. <br><br>
     
    
    <i>(The first attempt: The summary based on my research using Figma) </i>
    </p>
   
  <img src="./img/First.png" >

  <br><br>
  <p>The second reason was that I was stuck on the YouTube website style. I thought the infographic is to convey the information. So, I had to make something that is easy to understand with a clear hierarchy. 
    <br><br>
    <i>(The second attempt: The sketch based on my summary using Figma)</i>
  </p>

  <img src="./img/Second.png" >
  <br><br>
  <p>I did not like my sketches. I felt as if I just made a replica of the YouTube website. After seeing prof Alex's example, I checked the Behance to think outside of the box. And then, 
    I started to sketch to change my thoughts and tools. I tried to draw some sketches to make creative layouts. 
<br><br>
<i>(The sketches to make new layouts) </i> </p>
<img src="./img/sketch.jpg">
<div class="sub">
  <b> Iteration </b> 
 </div>
 <p>I liked this compostion. So, I started to develop this sketch 
   <br><br>
   <i>(The sketch I chose) </i>
   
 </p>
 <img class="iteration" src="./img/s1.jpg">
 <img class="iteration" src="./img/s2.jpg" >
 
 <img class="iteration" src="./img/s3.jpg" >
 <img class="iteration" src="./img/s4.jpg" >
 <img class="iteration" src="./img/semifinal.jpg" >
 <p>Based on the feedback, I added the time for the others category. I also adjusted some typesetting. I put the average time of the laptop close to the object. Finally, I put all the information on my infographic.
